Extended Yale Face Database B
Please refer to this link for detailed information. 
For this database, we simply use the cropped images (which can be downloaded here) and resize them to 32x32 pixels. This dataset now has 38 individuals and around 64 near frontal images under different illuminations per individual.

32x32 Data File:	contains variables 'fea' and 'gnd'. Each row of 'fea' is a face; 'gnd' is the label. Sample images 
A random subset with p(=5,10,...,50) images per individual was taken with labels to form the training set, and the rest of the database was considered to be the testing set. For each given p, there are 50 randomly splits: 
5 Train | 10 Train | 20 Train | 30 Train | 40 Train | 50 Train |
